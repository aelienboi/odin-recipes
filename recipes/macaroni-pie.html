 <h2>Description</h2>
 <p>Caribbean macaroni pie is a beloved baked macaroni and cheese dish that no gathering can go without, especially during the holidays. It’s crowd pleasing, tasty, and economical. Whenever there is a holiday potluck the question is always, “Who made the macaroni pie?” There’s a silent judgment in the air and to get a “pass” it means the pie has to be tasty on its own and also complement everything else on the plate, such as a comforting Sunday afternoon lunch of stewed chicken, callaloo, and green fig salad. If you're used to a saucy macaroni and cheese but want to try something new for your holiday menus, this version is the perfect way to bring Caribbean flavor to a classic American favorite.</p>

    <h2> Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
        <li>Cook the pasta</li>
        <p>Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil. Add 1 tablespoon of salt and the pasta, stirring to loosen any clumps of pasta that stick together. Cook the pasta, stirring occasionally, according to the package directions.
            Drain the pasta and return it to the same pot. Add the butter and toss until the butter is completely melted and the pasta is coated. Cover the pot with a lid and set aside off the heat as you continue to prep the remaining ingredients. </p>
        <li>Make the milk mixture: </li>
        <p>While the pasta cooks, whisk together the evaporated milk, eggs, ketchup, and mustard in a 4-cup measuring cup or medium bowl until combined. Set aside.</p>
        <li>Cook the aromatics</li>
        <p>Heat the oil in a small frying pan over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and pimento peppers and sauté until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.</p>
        <li>Assemble:</li>
        <p>Add the aromatics to the pasta along. Season with the black pepper, paprika, 1 teaspoon salt, and cayenne pepper, if using. Mix thoroughly to ensure the seasonings distribute well throughout the pasta. 

            Pour the milk mixture over the pasta and give it a good stir. Add about 3/4 of the cheese, a little at a time. Continue to mix until all the cheese is mixed in (it does not have to be completely melted). 
            
            Transfer to a 9x12 of 9x13-inch baking dish or aluminum foil pan. Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top.</p>
        <li>Bake the pie:</li>
        <p>Cover the baking dish or pan with a piece of aluminum foil. Bake for 25 minutes, then remove the foil and continue baking until it’s golden brown and bubbling on top, about another 20 minutes. If you’d like a dark golden crust, let it bake an additional 5-6 minutes. If you shake the pan gently, the macaroni should not jiggle.
